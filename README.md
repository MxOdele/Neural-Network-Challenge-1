## Overview

### *The Assignment*

The Module 18 Challenge tasked us with helping a company create a model that will predict whether a borrower will repay their loan, and to provide a more accurate interest rate. Specifically for student loan repayments.

### *Written in*

Jupyter Notebook using Python v3.10.13, Pandas, scikit-learn, pathlib, and TensorFlow/Keras

### *Accessing the notebook*

To access the spam detector notebook, simply download the `.ipynb` file `student_loans_with_deep_learning.ipynb` into a local directory, then load the `student_loans_with_deep_learning.ipynb` file into Jupyter Notebook through your terminal.

---

## Execution

### *How to use*

Simply `Run All Cells` to execute the code in every cell of the notebook in sequence. Alternatively, each cell may be `Run` on its own, though it is still recommended to run them in order.

### *Breaking down the code*

Below is a more in-depth explanation of the various cells coded within the `student_loans_with_deep_learning.ipynb` notebook.
